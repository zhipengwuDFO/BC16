    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Only two surveys were coho were observed and one of them the fish visibility was medium. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Surveys caught the tail end of the spawning. No surveys were done during peak spawn. (3) CO & CM Run 1 Enumeration Class: Poor survey coverage so enumeration class has been set as inspection only. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Peak-Live+Dead (28) used to calculate escapement. Expanded by 70% to account for Observer Efficiency. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Surveys provided from the Sechelt Indian Band. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: The peak spawning time recorded on the stream inspection log is Nov. 27th - during that survey fish visibility was medium and reliability was marked as being low. (20) On Predator Interactions: No record of predators reported on the stream inspection logs. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Peak Live plus dead estimate using two periods. The first curve covers the period up to 26 November, and the second covers the period after this date. The first peak was expanded by 50% to cover entire reach and an observer efficiency of 80% was used. 18 coho was estimated for this period. 70% Observer Efficiency and 40% coverage was used for the second period for an estimate of 11 coho. Total of 29 coho.",
