    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: spot checks by local residents. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Reliability is difficult to compare to other systems. Creek runs through densely populated areas and into Golf Course channels and ponds. Some areas looked at on a daily basis and others [North Fork] not at all. System of contacts about fish whereabouts is well developed. Details as to exact whereabouts and dates is not kept but others have more clear information. Contact Comox CA. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: This estimate comes from talking to streamkeeper/organizer and putting together anecdotal info in a conservative way. Some think 300 would be a more accurate number, and they may certainly be correct. (7) Enhancements: A weir is planned to be built next summer. Also, beaver dams and ponds are planned to be improved. (13) Drought: Extreme drought from spring to early fall. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: 3000 dead smolts found in north fork. (20a) Predator counts by date and predator type: Mink, otters, and dogs as well as other predators have been observed. (21) Other Sampling Activities or Studies: 3713 smolts counted this year.",
