    "Comments on condition": "(4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: The basis this year is a combination of the historic technique and what I believe the future methodology will be. I looked at the numbers seen holding as well as available spawning and holding habitat that wasn't covered. The number used is a conservative figure. 80 male and 93 female were captured for brood stock by FSBES of which about 60 were later returned to the system because they took more than the agreed upon number. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Reliability based on frequency and completeness of the visits (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Estimates were based on conservative counts at regular intervals and a 7-10 day stream life. (7) Enhancements: Fanny Bay Salmon Enhancement Society continues to operate their hatchery program. D. Clough Contracting maintains continuity with previous Resource Restoration plan. Fry salvage from local systems resides here. Puntledge Hatchery captive brood program uses former Omega site. New bottling plant hasn't changed system enough to register complaints from local users that can be verified. (9) Upslope instability: Severe gravel build-up continues. Same problem in several Baynes Sound streams. (13) Drought: Extreme low water - Spring through early Fall (16) Fish access recommendations: Creek bed dry close to mouth during fall migration for short periods. With low water few chums get above the old fence. (20a) Predator counts by date and predator type: Normal local predators. Seals at mouth, light bear activity this year, and eagles. (21) Other Sampling Activities or Studies: brood stock capture and return. See above",
