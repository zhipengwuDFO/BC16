    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: Spot Checks. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: The Sept. 30th survey was conducted by Dick Tritschler, Kent Simpson and Clyde Murray; the primary purpose was to check out the system. The other three surveys were on Haskins Creek, which is a tributary to Ruby Creek, and they were conducted by the coho survey crew. Mixal Lake and Klein Creeks are also tributaries to Ruby Creek and a separate BC16 has been done on Mixal Lake Creek. No chum were observed on the surveys but could be due to poor survey timing and locations surveyed. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Not enough surveys and poor timing to enter spawn run timing. Surveyors noted Dec. 7th as the peak spawn but there is not enough information to confirm the timing for this year. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Extremely high jack ratio almost 50%. (20) On Salmon Distribution: On the Sept. 30th survey - 3 coho were seen in the most northerly braid below the 10km bridge. Spot checks were made throughout the system and lots of coho fry were seen in all locations. (20) On Predator Interactions: No predators reported on the stream inspection logs. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Peak Live count on Haskins Creek. Survey life of coho in this creek is very short (3 days? ) due to exposure to predators and small system. Spawning behavior is for the fish to wait in Sakinaw Lake until ready to spawn, then to move to the creek and spawn simultaneously. The best method for estimating the return is to do a live count during this period.",
