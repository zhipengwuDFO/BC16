    "Comments on condition": "(13) Drought: Extreme dry seaon from spring to early fall. Residents report fry trapped in pools . Referred to local C.A. (16) Fish access recommendations: refer to 15 below. (7) Enhancements: USHP has provided some training and funding for volunteers to do mapping and surveys of the two Denman Island streams, Beadnell (Fillongley Park) and Valens (south end into Baynes Sound) . Fry abundance has also been studied. More work is planned for the future, including GPS maps. USHP and CA should have details. Local contact - Jenny Balke 335-2151. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Valens Creek has Beaver Dam that locals are concerned with. They relate talking to MELP re: dealing with the issue. Also, community quite concerned about Logging on ephemeral streams. Large amount of the watersheds on both Island streams has been logged in the last few years and more is planned for the future. (20a) Predator counts by date and predator type: Local residents very concerned about commercial fishing on east shore of Denman at time of returning coho. (3) CO Run 1 Enumeration Class: Three local residents who have been most active in stream asssessments and habitat issues in the past were contacted. None of them surveyed the stream for adults or were able to provide credible information on spawner counts ie. 20 fish in Valens but identification questionable. Due to new stream enumeration regime inspired by Stock Assessment and lengthy commercial fishery this writer was unable to survey the stream.",
