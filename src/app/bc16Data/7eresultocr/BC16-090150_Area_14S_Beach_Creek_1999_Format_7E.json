    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: Spot checks by streamkeeper's. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Since it is a presence /absence estimate the reliability is relatively high due to my confidence in the knowledge of the observers. (3) CO Run 1 Enumeration Class: Not enough sittings for anything other than presence /absence this year. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: No concerted look for this species. (3) CM Run 1 Enumeration Class: No CM was observed in the creek. Carcasses were noted along the beach. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: A network of streamkeeper's look at this system during the fall migration. They seem to be quite keen and knowledgeable. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Not enough fish observed to make any comments re: this item. (7) Enhancements: A contract for $75,000 has been let out to tender for culvert improvements and works that would divert the stream around the Old Dutch Inn and create better habitat. Funding by Eco-Action 2000. A USHP study using SHIM standards has been completed on this system as well as neighbouring Grandon. Money has been raised to start a database as well. Funding is in place to get rid of the culvert barrier on Grandon Creek and create a series of step pools to enable migration.",
