    "Comments on condition": "(4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Because of the hatchery a reasonable amount of ongoing monitoring was undertaken. Streamkeepers and a biologist working for Highways made walks around peak migration. Their observations were reported. Previous counts to this system were never made so comparisons are not available. Interestingly the numbers seem similar to Dove Creek which was floated by Stock Assessment. (2) PK Run 1 Reliability: Several walks made near peak under excellent conditions. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: Counts were made by volunteers and TRTF staff under excellent conditions at peak . (7) Enhancements: 1 mil. Pink eggs from Quinsum were incubated in the Hatchery. Losses from silt mold appear to be about 25% at time of report. Silt assumed to be from new Highway construction. Water released from Wolf lake in mid-July. Streamside wells [new] monitored increased flow in Tsolum. (13) Drought: Extremely dry summer and early fall. Ongoing attention is needed to this system because of problems building Highway. TRTF has identified restoration projects to work on in the future.",
