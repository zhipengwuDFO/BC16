    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: A SHIM inventory was done during the migration and observations were made incidental to that work. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Reliability high because it was presence /absence (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: The SHIM survey personnel found 2 live and 2 dead CO altogether. Considering the amount of time spent on the system and the number of people involved as well as the early Nov. sustained high water at which time little information was available a figure of about 20 fish seems like a reasonable guess as a conservative number. (7) Enhancements: Field work for a SHIM habitat assessment was completed this year on the mainstem of this system (which local residents call Beadnell). Other tribs may be done in the future. A Garmin GPS was used at the time and a Trimble (current standard) will be used to reference certain points in the future. The data is being collated and final reports were not ready at the time of this report. (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Local residents and MELP did Electro- shocking and fry trapping in the spring. A stream at the south end of the island called Valens Creek has had extensive SHIM survey work done on it through the last few years. School children have been out-planting fry in that system. Local contacts have been concerned about a culvert impeding migration because they find almost no fry above it. Coho have been reported in that system for years and some reports of CM in the lower reaches. No adults were sighted this year. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Not enough information was collected this year to make any determinations regarding run timing on.",
