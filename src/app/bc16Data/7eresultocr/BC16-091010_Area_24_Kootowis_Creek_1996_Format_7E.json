    "Comments on condition": "(15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Silt covers the bottom in many places, mostly in the mainstem and around the jams. (20) Predator Interactions: Some predation by bears occurs at the riffles in the lower reaches - approximately 60 chum. (7) Enhancements: This system was seriously impacted by poor logging practices. Many areas are paved with logging and shake debris with some stretches covering 50 metres long and 7 metres wide. In the summer of '94 a stream clearing project was initiated clearing out debris on the rifle range tributary. The summer of 1996 saw an FRBC stream clearing project started, three, five man crews cleared 4km of the upper reaches of the tributary. Tofino, and Thornton creek hatchery have been enhancing this system since 1992. In the fall of 1996, we had a total of 11 trips to Kootowis creek 7 of these to collect broodstock. A total of 45 females and 48 males were gathered. At the present time, we have 100,161 Kootowis coho eggs. The natural tea coloured water in this system combined with a large number of log jams makes this a difficult system to access. The first 4 assessments were made by boat in the tidal bay area where counts are made by counting schools as they move in over the flats with the tide. The other trips were spot checks during our broodstock collection efforts.",
