    "Comments on condition": "(5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Poor visibility in the lower section of the river due to high tide events throughout the survey season. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Chum were already present in creek when surveyors began. Surveyors noted that new coho were still arriving on the Dec. 13th survey. (7) Enhancements: On Dec 7th, 2 female and 6 male coho were taken for broodstock between the estuary and the railway bridge and 3 females and 1 male were taken between the railway bridge and the marker at the top of the reach. (10) Debris jams: Surveyors noted on the Oct. 25th survey that two cedar tree blown downs were cut and removed from the bank approximately 800 meters below Highway 19. (13) Drought: Nov. 9th, flows were still too low for fish to access the upper reaches. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Surveyors were suspicious on the Nov. 2nd survey because of the absence of live and dead fish. There were a few remains of fish left by predators. On Dec. 13thsurveyors found a dead Blue Heron on the Anderson property above the Island Highway. The bird was taken to PBS then passed on to MoELP. (20) On Predator Interactions: Blue Herons, eagles, American Dippers, a red tail hawk, and a kingfisher were all observed. Surveyors also noted that there were signs of angling (rod rests and trampled vegetation) on the Nov. 2nd survey in the lower segments. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: This escapement does not include Whitehouse Creek, a tributary to Bonsall Creek. Two AUC curves used. The first one covers the period up to 26 Nov 2000 using a survey life of 17.9 days and the second curve starts on 27 Nov 2000 and uses 9.8 day survey life. The two estimates were 257 and 1117 respectively. A zero count was added on 27 Dec 2000. Jack return estimate was based on the observed ratio between jacks and adults through the surveys and applying this ratio to the AUC estimate. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Estimate is derived from an expanded Peak live plus dead. The data collected suggests the run was split into two periods, separated by low water. The Peak L+D were 58 and 88 respectively for a total of 146. This was expanded for Observer Efficiency to 200.",
