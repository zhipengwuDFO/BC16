    "Comments on condition": "(5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: On the Dec. 14th survey, there were no adults observed but lots of juveniles. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Chum were already present when surveys began. (7) Enhancements: Habitat excellent, surveyors noted on the Oct. 18th survey that the recent enhancement work looks good. Oct. 31st, 26 coho were caught by hatchery staff for broodstock. Nov. 19th, one male and one female chum taken. (8) Unusual moralities: High pre-spawn moralities reported on Nov. 7th survey. Pre-spawn moralities confirmed by roe or milt sac presence. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Logging at Regan's pool, close to creek. 4x4 vehicle tracks were observed Nov. 21st throughout the upper creek, in the streambed and across spawning gravel (including known redds) . (20) On Predator Interactions: American Dippers, Blue Heron, Kingfisher and signs of otter predation was observed by surveyors. On Nov. 1st, three dead chum were observed under Highway 19 Bridge, the tails were cut off and left in the creek. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: AUC estimate. This run was divided into an early and a late run by low water. An AUC estimates was used for each segment. Suvey life was 17.9 and 5.0 days respectively to get estimates of 63 and 64 respectively. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Peak Live plus Dead was 66 on 1 Nov 2000. Expanded for Observer Efficiency to 75.",
