    "Comments on condition": "(2) CM & CN Run 1 Reliability: Only one survey where chum and chinook were observed. (3) CM & CN Run 1 Enumeration Class: Only one survey where chum and chinook were observed, so inspection only has been chosen for the enumeration class. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM & CN Run 1: Poor survey coverage for chum and chinook so the Expanded Peak-Live+Dead was used to calculate the escapement estimate. Escapement numbers were expanded by 90% - surveyors feel that they observed 90% of the populations. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Survey conducted on Nov. 16th was done by the coho survey crew - Jim Wilson and Johnny Ellis. Surveys beginning in December and continuing throughout January were conducted by the Sechelt Indian Band. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Coho, chum and chinook were already present in the stream when the first survey was conducted. (8) Unusual moralities: High pre-spawn mortality reported on the Dec. 27th stream inspection log. High water temperatures were reported on Jan 2nd. (10) Debris jams: Debris jams were reported on the Dec. 27th and Jan 2nd stream inspection logs. On Dec 27th the Sechelt Indian Band removed tree debris out of the pool #6 outlet. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Riparian cover loss reported by the Sechelt Indian Band throughout December and January. (19) Other restoration recommendations: The road leading down to the channel needs some work done on the cross ditches. Suggestions needs more riparian, rocks and cobble to stop silting off the pools. (20a) Predator counts by date and predator type: Dec. 5th - 2 eagles observed (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Only one inspection during peak spawning period. Other inspections done in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001 were not considered in estimate. Run size was estimated by comparing with Wilson Creek. Using the ratio between the estimated count on 14 Nov 2000 (36) with the calculated AUC estimate (127) of Wilson Creek, to expand from the Chapman Count on 16 Nov 2000 (549) to an estimated total of 1937.",
