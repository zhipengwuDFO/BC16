    "Comments on condition": "(5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: This Creek has a volunteer who lives at the mouth. It is monitored daily by his observations. (1) Other methods for CO Run 1: Volunteer living at the mouth checks daily. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Fish could have been missed if they migrated in the night. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: observations from the mouth, some walks. (1) Other methods for CM Run 1: observations on a daily bases from the mouth (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: this system was checked enough that if there were any adult chums they would have been seen. (7) Enhancements: This system has Lang Creek chum fry released into it for the past 4 years. A spawning channel was build this fall to accomdate the first return, however it turned into an over winter rearing channel as it had too low of flows for a spawning channel. Everybody was disappointed that a few chums never returned, however with the low returns on some of the Powell River chum streams one should not give up.",
