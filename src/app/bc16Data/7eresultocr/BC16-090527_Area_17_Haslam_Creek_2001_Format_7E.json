    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: The 6 surveys had mostly good to excellent conditions, however, the peak was missed due to flooding. Therefore to complete the Area Under the Curve calculation a hypothetical count of 250 in the system was added on 20th Nov. This was derived from the pattern of escapement counts on neighbouring Bush Cr. Also the last 2 surveys (5th and 12th Dec. ) only covered the top 4300m of the 7200m accessible to coho. The actual counts of 77 and 36 were expanded to give an estimate of 110 and 72 coho present in the reaches surveyed. These numbers were further expanded to 138 and 90, respectively, to represent full system counts. 80% of the coho in the creek were assumed to be in the upper sections surveyed by this time of the run. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Area Under the Curve calculation using 13.7 days survey life (Cowie Cr. Study Fall 2001) . Zero counts at the beginning and end, and a hypothetical peak count (250 on 20th Nov. ) were added to the survey observations (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Coverage and Observer Efficiency was excellent for the surveys up to 7th November. There was a break of three weeks until the next survey at the beginning of December, however, the bulk of the chum run was covered by these first four surveys. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Area Under the Curve calculation using 15 days for the survey life. A zero count was added one week prior to the first survey on 16th October",
