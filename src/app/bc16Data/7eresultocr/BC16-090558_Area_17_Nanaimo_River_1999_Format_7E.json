(4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Visual observations from stream walks and helicopter overflights. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CN Run 1: Estimate from Hatchery crew as to 1st run/2nd run split. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CN Run 2: Hatchery crew swim surveys, and in River beach seining. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Stream walk surveys were conducted on the North Nanaimo Creek (alternative name: Blackjack Creek) 29-Oct-99; 19-Nov-99; 26-Nov-99; 03-Dec- 99; and 08-Dec-99 by Chris Peters and Charles Thirkill. Coho were observed 4 times, 100 % of the spawn habitat was covered, reliability was rated at 4, enumeration class: 1, and an estimate of 130 adults and 20 jacks was derived from AUC calculations assuming a 14 day survey life. One (1) steelhead was observed, reliability: 1, and enumeration class: 4. On 08-Dec-99 wolf and bear tracks were observed. Information was compiled by Steve Baillie at PBS.",
