    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: There were so many chums in the system during the peak of the coho migration some may have been missed. High water hampered inspection after the peak of the chum run. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Weekly counts were done, however it was difficult to count the chums during the peak due to crowding. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: The coho estimate for Kelly creek is unknown, only 3 coho were sighted on 10 inspections of the system between Sept. 30/98 and Nov. 24/98. There were so many chums in the system it was impossible to see coho if any were there. High water conditions made conditions impossible on the last two inspections (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Estimate based on the weekly stream inspections. There was crowding with this amount of spawning chums in this system. a percentage were lost to overcrowding (see inspection log #4787 ) Also there was evidence of free floating eggs. (8) Unusual mortalities: estimate that 2 to 3, 000 chums died before spawning due to crowding, low water, and standing's in the inter tidal. (13) Drought: the water levels in Kelly Creek were below normal for the month of October and the first half of November.",
