    "Comments on condition": "(5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: The Powell River Salmon Society has a fence and counting facility just up stream from Highway 101. They have done the numerations of this system for approximately the past 15 years. Two people are employed at the fence during the migration of the adult salmon. Salmon are stopped at the fence and then guided into a tank in a building there they are sorted, brood stock is held in this building in an elaborate holding system. The non-brood stock are released either into the spawning channel which is adjacent to the river or back into the river upstream of the fence. The spawning channel discharges into Lang Creek just downstream of the fence and is equipped with a fence of its own. Chums are counted through this fence during the heaviest migration of the chums. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Fence count (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Actual count at the fence. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: 168 pinks passed through the fence, 40 more were observed spawning downstream of the fence. Fence count: 75 males, 93 females (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: This estimate may be conservative, as part of the count is estimates that were done during high water. (3) PK Run 1 Enumeration Class: The majority of the count is based on actual fence count however some estimates are used when water levels are in flooding conditions. (3) CM Run 1 Enumeration Class: The count is based on actual counts that are down at the fence however some estimates are made on weekends, and during flooding conditions. (3) CM Run 2 Enumeration Class: The chinooks were all counted during ideal conditions and every fish passed through the facility.",
