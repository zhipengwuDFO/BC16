    "Comments on condition": "(4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: unknown (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: Three walks of the system were performed during pink spawning as per SILs and inspection dates. Peak live plus dead counts were used with a variable stream life factor based on conditions observed. A massive pink run in the Puntledge saw large numbers backing out and spawning in the Tsolum over a longer than normal period this year. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Only one complete walk was used this year and extrapolations were made on the basis of the run timing to the Puntledge. (3) CO Run 1 Enumeration Class: This system was only inspected incidental to pink and chum enumeration. (20a) Predator counts by date and predator type: All common predators on this system. Seals still sighted during migration of adults as far as the confluence with Puntledge. Another year of a selective culling on a few in-river seals. Cull quite effective in reducing to near zero the number of seals feeding on smolt out migration in the narrow portions of the Courtenay River. (7) Enhancements: The Tsolum River Task Force did not receive any funding for 1999. Some funds were available from sources for ongoing study of the effects of Acid Mine Drainage, but virtually all restoration and habitat evaluation has ceased. Most of the unfinished habitat inventories are available through Project Watershed. (9) Upslope instability: Continued evidence of gravel build-up. (18) Flow augmentation: Wolf Lake dam was opened as usual mid-August and augmented low summer flow by an additional 15-25 cfs. A better than normal flow was established all summer and no barrier to pink migration was noted. Copper content appears to be about half of what it was a few years ago at peak output. Bioassays however show that CO fry are negatively effected by the copper levels.",
