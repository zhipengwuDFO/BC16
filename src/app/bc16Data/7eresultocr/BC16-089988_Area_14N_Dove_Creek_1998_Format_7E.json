    "Comments on condition": "This system was chosen by Stock Assessment for a weekly spawner assessment. (7) Enhancements: Inland Highway is being constructed through this system with typical effects. Problems associated with this to be expected over the next few years. (13) Drought: Extremely low water late spring to early fall. Assessment in Sept. however found much fry thriving in pools. (19) Other restoration recommendations: A survey of this system is being planned by Tsolum River Task Force. (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Assume normal predation, bears birds etc. Co. Ct and Rw juveniles noted in good numbers during fry trapping survey. Two Sthd adults noted by survey crew. (21) Other Sampling Activities or Studies: Details of fry trapping study in Comox office as well. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: PBS crew did surveys and K. Simpson did AUC. However, about 75% of the system not surveyed. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: This is the section estimate that was surveyed. No extrapolation of this system was performed. No spawner records to compare this number to anyway.",
