    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: No systematic effort undertaken to count spawners. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Volunteers that work at the hatchery did random walks and spot checks. 11 fish were seen at different times. 6 were observed at one time near the bridge at the estuary. Since a small % pop was covered on that date I feel confident that at least 25 fish spawned in the system, probably more. A presence notation would be more accurate I realise, but would not represent the probability that a significant seeding took place. (7) Enhancements: 17,800 fry were obtained from Qualicum Hatchery last April 12. All but 2000 were released so far. Excellent survival was reported. An unknown number of eyed eggs will be received from Qualicum around the middle of February. (16) Fish access recommendations: Hatchery staff are concerned that beaver dams and other debris jams are hindering the migration of salmonids. They plan to walk system early next year. They seem to be aware of the benefit of some obstructions but were informed that permission should be obtained before in-stream work is carried out. A U. Vic. student put together a habitat inventory that is to be placed on file at the Comox office.",
