    "Comments on condition": "(2) PK Run 1 Reliability: Spot checks to determine peak and two good walks at excellent stream conditions. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Not walked enough hatchery dumped 2000 chums in various places, and high water during peak. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: Walks; almost complete survey of grounds at excellent conditions. (3) CO Run 1 Enumeration Class: On Oct. 27, 100 coho were reported in a pool below Wolf Creek. Miscellaneous reports of more in mainstem up to gunbarrel. The system is too long and the water is too dark and high for reliable enumeration (7) Enhancements: The Tsolum River Task Force is a community based organization that has been allocated about $360, 000 from Federal And Provincial funds over the past two years. They have been active in the following areas: -- Acid Mine Drainage: sampling, monitoring and developing plan for containing AMD -- Enhancement: 1 mil. Pink eggs to Headquarters Hatchery -- Water Monitoring: for quality and flows -- Restoration: various projects including streamside revegetation and water flow augmentation. -- Habitat Assessment and Mapping (11) Bank erosion: Clay banks sloughing in and mud and silt from upstream watershed logging appear to be problems. Silt from highway construction entering system through Dove and Wolf Creeks. New Inland Highway construction over the next few years will cause stress on watershed. (13) Drought: Extreme drought during summer and early fall. (16) Fish access recommendations: Resident blocks stream for swimming pool. This is the second time in 9 years that this has happened. System must be walked before pink migration. (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Some fishing activity even though system closed. Otherwise normal predation.",
