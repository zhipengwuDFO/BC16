    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Conditions were good to excellent for most surveys except for 3rd Dec during a flood . This survey was not used in the Area Under the Curve calculation. The final count (19 on 10th Dec. ) was expanded to 63 as conditions were fair and only the lower 1200m of the 2000m accessible to salmon was surveyed. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: AUC calculation based on 8 of the 9 surveys performed. The first 4 surveys had zero counts for coho. 13.7 day survey life was used based on the Cowie Cr. Fall 2001 study. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Observer Efficiency was good to excellent for most surveys. Water levels were very low until mid November and surveys prior to this time, which only covered the lower segments, were considered to have 100% coverage of salmon present. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Area Under the Curve calculation using 15 days for the survey life. Zero counts were added one week before and after surveys were performed.",
