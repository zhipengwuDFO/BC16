    "Comments on condition": "(2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Low reliability - one survey where coho were observed and surveyor estimate that they saw 65% of the population. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Low reliability - 2 surveys where chum were observed. (2) CN Run 1 Reliability: Low reliability - only one chinook jack was observed on the October survey. (3) CN Run 1 Enumeration Class: Poor survey timing for chinook, therefore A. P. (Adults Present) was entered as the escapement estimate was enter. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Expanded Peak-Live+Dead was used to calculate the escapement estimate. Surveyors observed 30 live and 5 dead coho and estimate that they counted 65% of the population. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Expanded Peak-Live+Dead was used to calculate the escapement estimate. 125 live chum observed on Oct. 26th (surveyor estimated 80% of population) and 199 dead chum observed on November 16th (surveyor estimated 90% of population) equalling 324 chum expanded by 85% for a total escapement of 381 adult chum. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Two surveys were done on Nov. 16th, one by Rick Hobbs and the other by Charles Thirkill & Chris Peters. Rick's survey was conducted in the morning and targeted chum in the lower reaches. Charles and Chris targeted coho, their survey was done in the afternoon from the Weyerhaeuser Bridge to the powerline above the section that Rick Surveyed. Rick Hobbs originally prepared the BC16 and the escapement estimates were updated January 2002 to incorporate the coho survey. Changes to the escapement estimates BC16 originally submitted by Rick Hobbs are as follows: coho - 54 was entered in place of the N.O. (None Observed) / chum - increase from 300 to 381. / chinook - decrease from 50 to A. P. (Adults Present) . (20) On Predator Interactions: No observations of predators recorded on the Stream Inspection Logs .",
