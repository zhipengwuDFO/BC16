    "Comments on condition": "(7) Enhancements: Downstream migration of coho smolts were monitored in stream in 2000. In Sept. of 2000 an adult counting fence was constructed approx. 75m downstream of Highway 101. 12 chums migrated upstream of the fence prior to Oct. 24, then a further 42. 20 were observed spawning downstream of the fence. Prior to 1998 chums could not pass the Highway culvert on Highway 101. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: This is the first year of fence operations. The fence was installed on 19 October 2000. Water levels were low, but high enough to permit fish passage prior to installation. The fence was operated continuously until 12-Jan-2001, except for a 7 hour period on 20-October-2000. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Coho were able to bypass fence prior to installation. 5 coho were observed in area 2 days prior to installation. Fence was topped for 7 hours on 20-Oct-00 (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: 5 coho adults observed prior to fence, plus 22 coho (20 males, 8 females, 2 unknown) enumerated through fence. This is a minimum count. There was likely others that passed the fence area unobserved. (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: Chum were able to bypass fence prior to installation. 12 chum were observed in area 2 days prior to installation. Fence was topped for 7 hours on 20-Oct-00 (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Minimum estimate of escapement. 12 chum were observed prior to fence installation and are presumed to have moved upstream. 26 chum were enumerated through the fence, 20 chums were estimated to be spawning downstream of fence.",
