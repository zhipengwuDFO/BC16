    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: density during brood stock capture with net. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: system too large and methods not defensible, but many people surveyed with info on this species. (3) CO Run 1 Enumeration Class: choosing a number rather than mere p/a seems more informative as long as number is relative to same type of observations other years. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Discussion with Hatchery staff and DFO technician. (2) PK Run 1 Reliability: Good flight near peak spawn as well as inspection of major spawning channel. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: explained earlier (1) Other methods for CM Run 1: counts at fish trap (2) CM Run 1 Reliability: large system, high water near peak spawn made counts difficult. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Discussions with volunteers and hatchery staff and DFO tech. Observations on river and in side channels. Could easily be out by 50% (1) Other methods for CN Run 1: brood capture with nets and observations at spawning grounds. (7) Enhancements: The Rippengale Habitat Restoration Channel, a 3 km. rearing channel, was built this year. The design and engineering worked out well. Much l.o.d. was introduced and spawning salmon of all species frequented the facility. It is located downstream of the hatchery and is connected to older channels. Two new assessment fences were built, one on #3 channel and one on the main channel, were constructed and can be used to count juvenile and adult salmon. (11) Bank erosion: A large clay bank has been sloughing in and causing downstream silting. Assessment will be done this year and a plan may be funded in the future to stabilize it. (13) Drought: Extremely low water - spring through early fall. (7) Enhancements: Entrance to Raven channel and York Rd. channel need work. Juvenile assessments planned for this spring subject to funding. (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Extreme bear predation in York Rd channel during pink spawn. Normal sport fishery for pinks and coho off the shore. Saltwater fishery and instream coho fishery catch and release this year.",
