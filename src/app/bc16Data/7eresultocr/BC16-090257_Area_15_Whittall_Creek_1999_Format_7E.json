    "Comments on condition": "(4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Coho were observed spawning just above highway 101 on a couple of the inspections. One inspections was done up above the Powerline with the manager for PRSS, we looked at a area where he has seen coho spawn in previous years, conditions were good and we found only one carcass which indicated that the coho return this year was light. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: Water levels very low when the pinks came in. A black bear was near the mouth and predation was heavy. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CM Run 1: Escapement estimation is based on stream inspections between Sept. 28 to Dec. 02/99 Water conditions were low until the first of November. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Only 50% of the spawning area was looked at on a weekly bases, however this area that was monitored was in the lower end of the system and the coho had to pass through it to get to upper spawning area. (16) Fish access recommendations: There are two dams that were put in years ago to supply water for a small hatchery. This hatchery was used by the PRSS to incubate pinks. The last year it was used was in 1997; it will not be used again, as there are major problems with the intake water. These dams stop the up stream migration of chums in all but high water conditions. Vee Knotchs were made in both dams by myself in Oct/99 during the low flows; this helped but did not rectify the problem. These dams must be looked at in the summer of 2000 to make proper passage for chums at normal flows.",
