    "Comments on condition": "Additional inspections: Dec/14 (2) PK Run 1 Reliability: Pinks were observed during all five inspections targeting pinks and the fish visibility was high in each survey. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: Escapement estimate provided by Charter Patrol Eli Rosengard. 230 pinks were observed on Sept. 7th. (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: Surveys conducted Oct. 4th and prior were performed by Eli Rosengard and targeted pink salmon. All later surveys were conducted by the coho survey crew (Laurence Box and Jack Newman) . One sockeye was reported as being observed on Sept. 7th, unable to confirm this observation and this river has no history of sockeye spawning so escapement estimate is entered as N.O. Fanny Bay Enhancement Society captured 29 coho for broodstock - 19 were captured on Oct. 31st and 10 were captured on Nov. 11th. (6) General Comments on Run Timing: Pink timing provided by Eli Rosengard. Pink were already present in the stream before the first survey. (7) Enhancements: Spawning channel present. (20) On Predator Interactions: No predators were recorded as being observed on the stream inspection logs.",
