    "Comments on condition": "(2) PK Run 1 Reliability: Local streamkeeper monitors this run constantly because this is second year of hatchery return. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults PK Run 1: This run is monitored on an ongoing basis, by local streamkeepers, and Rod Allen. I have often met R. Allen on the stream and have checked his estimates and feel that they are reliable. This is a return from 1 mil. Quinsum eggs. (7) Enhancements: Highway mitigation work was substantially finished this year. It included two sets of rearing channels. One, down from New Bridge was considered to be well constructed and working properly. The other, up from RR trestle was poorly finished and improperly leveled. It will need to be redone next year and could cause a silt problem this year. Rip Rap was placed at Rose Park amidst complaints from the resident down and across stream. (8) Unusual mortalities: Reports that Co were killed by otters upstream. (10) Debris jams: Reports that chums did not get above log jam-cascade located 400 m. above water intake Chums have previously been noted higher in the system. (11) Bank erosion: Ongoing problem at Rose Park. (13) Drought: Extremely dry, late spring to early fall. (16) Fish access recommendations: related in #8 (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Otter problem noted. Extensive chum fishery in area but 14-5 closed at times for protection of nearby systems. Beach fishery for coho [retention further south] not as productive as anticipated. Predation otherwise assumed normal- bears, birds, etc. This is the first year of extensive coho non-retention measures coastwide. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: PBS crew swam this system weekly. Later in season it covered the entire creek. CM by Box crew and R. Allen, on the basis of numerous observations.",
