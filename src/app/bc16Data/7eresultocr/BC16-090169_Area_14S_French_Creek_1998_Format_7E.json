    "Comments on condition": "(1) Other methods for CO Run 1: brood capture with nets and electroshockers. (2) CO Run 1 Reliability: Very little of this long system actually looked at. (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CO Run 1: Numbers have been based on observations from volunteers and DFO techs who have monitored this system looking for brood stock. Through the years various pools have been shown to indicate abundance and tell something of timing. Other areas are known to be prime spawning habitat. Various anecdotal info is put together by Hatchery manager, Techs, and Patrolman in global terms and translated to a number that tries to be meaningful in a relative way. Looking over the last few years and comparing to this year it could very easily be that we have been significantly underestimating in absolute terms. Good or better than recent average is certainly accurate! (7) Enhancements: Brood capture nets 95,000 eggs. Hatchery feels av/female was 2000 eggs whereas previously it was 1465. Capture program was hampered by long period of high water from mid-Nov. to end-Nov. Brood requirements were never met. Improvements this year include fish ladder up towards Coombs. (13) Drought: Extreme low water spring through early fall. (16) Fish access recommendations: Fish ladder as mentioned previously. (20) On Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Four weeks of SN and GN fishing just outside of a 1.5 mile radius boundary probably had an effect on this system although reported bycatch was small.",
