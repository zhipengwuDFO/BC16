    "Physical conditions (B) Particulars": "The R/H branch was consistently accessable this year, partly due the consistently good water levels.",
    "Physical conditions (C) Water levels": "Consistently good water levels through the spawning period. Flooding during the last two weeks of October.",

    "Biological conditions (F) Evidence": "None observed.",
    "Biological conditions (G) New obstructions": "The rock falls in the center branch were not passable during low water conditions, but there was a small number of fish above falls. A 1m. log jam has formed 100 m. above the creek fork, (200 m. from estuary.) in the L/H branch. It appears impassable at this time, but it should be looked at next year.",
    "Comments": "The timing on the chums seemed earlier this year than normal, as I was expecting to see more fresh fish on my last walk on 25-Oct.",
