    "Physical conditions (A) Evidence": "Major silting in lower 300 m. of main branch.",
    "Physical conditions (B) Particulars": "Course change at 300 m. in center branch due to silting and gravel movement. Early in the spawning season, when the water levels were low, part of the main branch was not accessable.",
    "Physical conditions (C) Water levels": "Consistently good water levels through the spawning period. Slight flooding during the last two weeks of October.",
    "Biological conditions (D) Particulars": "Majority of chums to 800 m.",
    "Biological conditions (E) Predators comments": "Slight impact from birds and bears.",
    "Biological conditions (F) Evidence": "None observed.",
    "Biological conditions (G) New obstructions": "This system should be carefully watched over the next few seasons, as obstructions will probably develop. The course change at this time seems to be only a problem under low water conditions, an attempt to change this would probably be unsuccessful.",
    "Comments": "Good seed of chums this year, but the top ol the system was only lightly utilized. Logging activity in the area has ceased.",
