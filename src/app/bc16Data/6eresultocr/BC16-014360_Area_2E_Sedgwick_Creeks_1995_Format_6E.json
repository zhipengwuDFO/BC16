    "Biological conditions (F) Evidence": "None observed.",
    "Biological conditions (G) New obstructions": "The R/H branch is still not accessable during low water conditions. Because of the amount of gravel involved, we must wait for the winter floods to make a channel. The rock falls in the center branch were not passable during low water conditions, and no fish were seen above the falls. This could have been due to the incredibly poor return.",
    "Comments": "Incredibly poor return of chums this year, but consistent with the rest of the sub-area.",
